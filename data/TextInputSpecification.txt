// This is not a valid comment.

NOTE: Empty lines are allowed.
  All lines containing no characters or whitespace (space, tab) will be ignored.

NOTE: By convention, text input files should use the ".text" suffix for easy
  identification, but the parser will NOT enforce this naming convention.

MetaData Format
===============
Name: One line of text representing the name of this text
Author: One line of text representing the text's author's name
    If unknown, use "Anonymous".
Date: One line containing one integer, which is the year in which the text was
    written.  If unknown, use 0.
Meter: 1 line - Period delimited list of syllable counts per line for each verse
    of text
Number of Verses: One line containing one integer, which is the number of verses
    listed subsequently in the file	


Verse Format
============
Verses: Text for each verse.  One line in input file is one line in one verse.
    Line breaks in the input file are dictated by the meter.
	Each line in the input file is a (white)space delimited list of Strings
	representing one syllable of the text for the given line.  By convention,
	when splitting an word into normal syllables, end all but the last syllable
	with a "-".  (Example: "A- maz- ing Grace,")
	NOTE: Spelling is not checked.
	NOTE: Punction is allowed as a part of a Syllable.
	NOTE: The number of Strings on each line must correspond with the expected
		number based on the tune's meter.
	NOTE: let L be the number of lines in each verse and N be the number of verses
		total number of lines in input file should be L x N.
    NOTE: line breaks in the generated sheet music may not match the line breaks
        in the input file
