			<line>How blessed the man who does not walk </line>
			<line>Where wick- ed men would guide his feet, </line>
			<line>Nor stands in paths with sin- fun men, </line>
			<line>Nor sits up- on the scor- ner's seat. </line>
			<line>Je- ho- vah's law is his de- light, </line>
			<line>His med- i- ta- tion day and night. </line>
		</verse>
		<verse>
			<line>He shall be like a grow- ing tree </line>
			<line>Im- plant- ed by the wa- ter- side </line>
			<line>Which in its sea- son bears its fruit </line>
			<line>And has a leaf that does not fade. </line>
			<line>In all that may his hands em- ploy </line>
			<line>He shall pros- per- i- ty en- joy. </line>
		</verse>
		<verse>
			<line>Not so the wick- ed: they are all </line>
			<line>Like chaff the wind will drive a- way. </line>
			<line>They shall not in the judg- ment stand, </line>
			<line>Nor sin- ners with the right- eous stay. </line>
			<line>The LORD the way of just men knows; </line>
			<line>The wick- ed to de- struc- tion goes. </line>
