			<line>I sing th'al- migh- ty power of God, </line>
			<line>That made the moun- tains rise, </line>
			<line>That spread the flow- ing seas a- broad, </line>
			<line>And built the lof- ty skies. </line>
			<line>I sing the wis- dom that or- dained </line>
			<line>The sun to rule the day: </line>
			<line>The moon shines full at his com- mand, </line>
			<line>And all the stars o- bey. </line>

			<line>I sing the good- ness of the Lord, </line>
			<line>That filled the earth with food: </line>
			<line>He formed the crea- tures with his word, </line>
			<line>And then pro- nounced them good. </line>
			<line>Lord, how thy won- ders are dis- played </line>
			<line>Wher- e'er I turn mine eye, </line>
			<line>If I sur- vey the ground I tread, </line>
			<line>Or gaze up- on the sky! </line>
		</verse>
		<verse>
			<line>There's not a plant or flower be- low, </line>
			<line>But makes thy glo- ries known; </line>
			<line>And clouds a- rise and tem- pests blow, </line>
			<line>By or- der from thy throne. </line>
			<line>Crea- tures, as nume- rous as they be, </line>
			<line>Are sub- ject to thy care: </line>
			<line>There's not a place where we can flee, </line>
			<line>But God is pre- sent there. </line>

			<line>In heav'n he shines with beams of love, </line>
			<line>With wrath in hell be- neath: </line>
			<line>'Tis on his earth I stand or move, </line>
			<line>And 'tis his air I breathe. </line>
			<line>His hand is my per- pet- ual guard, </line>
			<line>He keeps me with his eye: </line>
			<line>Why should I then for- get the Lord, </line>
			<line>Who is for ev- er nigh? </line>
