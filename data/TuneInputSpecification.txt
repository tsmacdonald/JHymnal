NOTE: Comments are allowed.
  All lines beginning with # will be ignored.
  Examples:
# This is a valid comment.
#This is also a valid comment.
 # This is not a valid comment.
// This is not a valid comment.

NOTE: Empty lines are allowed.
  All lines containing no characters or whitespace (space, tab) will be ignored.
  
NOTE: By convention, tune input files should use the ".tune" suffix for easy
  identification, but the parser will NOT enforce this naming convention.

MetaData Format
===============
Name: One line of text (spaces allowed) - this is the name for this tune.
Author: One line of text representing the tune's author's name
    If unknown, use "Anonymous".
Date: One line containing one integer, which is the year in which the tune was
    written.  If unknown, use 0.
Meter: 1 line - Period delimited list of syllable counts per line for each verse
    of text
Key Signature: One line of text
	Scientific pitch notation (without octave... see Note specifications)
	Note: Currently, only major keys are supported.
Time Signature: Space delimited list of 2 integer on one line
	(first is the number of beats in a measure, second is the duration of each beat)
Starting Beat: One integer for the starting beat in the measure (must conform to
	time signature)

============
A word on Key Signatures:
    The way Spring 2010 entered the notes (using absolute pitch) requires indicating
    if a note is flat, natural or sharp regardless of the key.  Therefore, when using
    (for example) LilyPond, one does not need to consider the key when rendering accidentals.
    However, if it is done manually (see worker.LAYOUTManager), the key must be considered
    when rendering accidentals.

Notes for each part: Space delimited list of notes for each syllable of text.  
	If a syllable of text requires more than one note, delimit the notes by semicolons.
	Notes are defined as a comma delimited list of the following:
	- Absolute pitch according to Scientific Pitch notation - either 2 or 3 characters
	  - pitch[accidental]octave
	  - pitch is the pitch on the note's staff
	    examples: bottom line treble cleff = E, bottom line bass cleff = G
	  - accidental (optional) - one character (s, n, or f)
	    NOTE: double accidentals are not supported
	  - octave - one integer representing the octave according to scientific pitch notation
	    middle C = 4
	  Example:
	  	F (first space on treble cleff) sharp	= Fs4
	  	B (second line on bass cleff) flat		= Bf2
	  	C (middle C) with no accidental			= C4
	- Duration denominator (ie. half note = 2, whole note = 1, eighth note = 8)
	- Whether the note is dotted (either "n" or ".")
	- Whether the note is tied to other notes ("n" - not involved in a tie, 
		"[" - begins a tie, "-" - middle of a tie, "]" - ends a tie)
	- Whether the note is slurred to other notes ("n" - not involved in a slur, 
		"[" - begins a slur, "-" - middle of a slur, "]" - ends a slur)
	Example:
		Dotted quarter note middle C slurred to an eighth note F sharp (first space
		in the treble clef).
		C4,4,.,n,[;Fs4,8,n,n,]
	NOTE: The music portion of the input file MUST include music for soprano, alto
		tenor and bass IN THAT ORDER.  
	NOTE: The number of syllables represented by the lists of one or more note 
		must conform to the expected number of syllables for that line based on 
		the meter.
	NOTE: Measure divisions will be computed.
